# 🌱 Arc 1: **The Onboarding Saga**

**Episode Title:** _“Summon the Guardian! Crash-Free Avatar Awakens!”_

---

### **Scene 1 — The Summoning**

_Interior — Dev’s apartment, late night sitting in front of his computer. The screen glitches violently, an unreadable error pulsing like a heartbeat._

- **Dev (muttering):** “I don’t even know what this means anymore… Why does it break just one day before release...”
- _The error swells until the room explodes in light. Dev falls through a tunnel of cascading code._

---

### **Scene 2 — The Guardian Appears**

_Dev awakens in the Code Realm — skyscrapers made of UI, streets flickering with log entries. A figure descends: Sentry-chan._

- **Sentry-chan:** “Welcome, Dev. This is your software — made manifest. And it’s collapsing.”
- **Dev (stumbling):** “Collapsing…?!”
- **Sentry-chan:** “The Bug Lords have awakened. If you wish to return, you must face them.”

---

### **Scene 3 — Errorion Appears**

_The air distorts. A glitching humanoid form emerges. Its cloak is made of unreadable stacktraces, endlessly shifting, like corrupted data refusing to stabilize._

- **Errorion (distorted voice):** “So… you’ve arrived. Yet you cannot read me. You can swing your sword all you like, but you’ll never understand my shape.”

- _Bug-minions pour from his body, wrecking the city around them._

- **Dev (panicked):** “I… I can’t even tell what I’m looking at!”

- **Sentry-chan (urgent):** “Then take this! The **Crash-Free Avatar** will give you the strength to survive!”

---

### **Scene 4 — Crash-Free Avatar (Basic Form)**

_Light engulfs Dev. Instead of detailed armor, it’s a simpler **glowing exosuit** — raw stability energy wrapping around them. A small emblem pulses faintly on their chest: the promise of crash-free sessions._

- **Sentry-chan (encouraging):** “This is only the beginning — a fraction of your true potential. Wield it well!”

- _A luminous **debug blade** forms in Dev’s hands. But its edge flickers, unstable, like it doesn’t fully “connect” to the enemy yet._

- **Dev (breathing hard):** “I… I’ll fight anyway!”

---

### **Scene 5 — The First Clash**

_Dev slashes through minions. They vanish in bursts of broken glyphs, but Errorion himself barely reacts. Each strike cuts, but doesn’t reveal anything. Errorion laughs as his cloak continues to glitch._

- **Errorion (mocking):** “You can fight… but you cannot _see_. Until you know my true form, you cannot defeat me.”

- _He retreats into the fog, leaving the battlefield scarred._

- **Dev (panting, frustrated):** “Even with this power… I don’t understand anything.”

- **Sentry-chan (calm, foreshadowing):** “Patience, Dev. Soon, an ally will arrive who can reveal what’s hidden.”

---

### **Closing Narration**

_The city flickers, covered in fog. The next trial looms._

- **Narrator (dramatic):** “Dev has gained the Crash-Free Avatar, but cannot yet see through the obfuscation. Next time: _The Source Map Wars!_”
